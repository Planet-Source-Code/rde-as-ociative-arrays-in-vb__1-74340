AssocArr.cls is a stand alone Associative Array class
and although it has fully functional FindNext and FindPrev
methods, as well as NextItem and PrevItem properties, it
does not have For-Each capability.

The Associative_Array folder contains a Dll project that
consists of two classes and a module, as well as a test
project. The Associative Array Dll library has the same
properties and methods but also has For-Each capability.
Please note that For-Each is quite slow compared to the
simple enumeration properties and methods provided.

The Custom_Enumerator folder contains a sample project
that consists of two classes and a module, which are the
basics needed for the For-Each enumerator functionality.
This brilliant light-weight For-Each example is thanks
to Kelly Ethridge.
